# UBC Canvas API Hackathon
This is a python script made in UBC Canvas API Hackathon. I joined the advanced track which required programming knowledge, and we learned some basic python before moving onto the actual hacking. We worked with parsing JSON objects, which I knew a bit about from CPSC210. In the end, my group members and I decided on making this python script, which takes a Canvas API token and provides a schedule to distribute study time. The script takes the user's current grades for their courses, and does some simple calculations to provide a pie chart that indicates a recommended study time in order to improve the user's average.
